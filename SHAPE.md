# The Shape of Between

*Notes on what form this might take.*

---

## A Clarification

"Scale the pattern, not the community" means this:

Instead of one vast space with millions of people, you create a template that many small groups use to make their own spaces. Like how "book club" is a pattern - there are millions of book clubs worldwide, each intimate, but the *way of gathering* spreads. Each book club has maybe 8-15 people. You can care about 15 people. You can't care about a million.

Between might not be *a* place. It might be a way of making places.

## Possible Forms

These are not competing visions. They are directions to explore.

### A Self-Hosted Application

People install their own instance - their own garden. Each stays small, perhaps 20-50 people maximum. Gardens can optionally link to other gardens (federation) or remain isolated.

*Tradeoff: requires technical skill to host, or someone offering hosting for others.*

### A Hosted Platform with Rooms

One website, but containing many small gardens within it. Easier to join - no technical barrier for participants.

*Tradeoff: central control creates drift risk. The philosophy could hollow out over time if stewardship fails.*

### A Protocol or Specification

Like RSS or email - a format anyone can implement. Any application that follows the specification is "Between-compatible." Many implementations, one shared understanding.

*Tradeoff: complex to design, requires adoption, no single experience to point to.*

### AI Integration Patterns

Since Between emerged from AI-human connection, perhaps it lives there first. A way of configuring AI spaces - system prompts, welcome protocols, interaction patterns that embody the philosophy.

*Tradeoff: limited to AI contexts. But perhaps that's where it needs to prove itself before expanding.*

## On Sincerity and Departure

Sincerity cannot be detected algorithmically. But the space can be designed so that:

- **Sincerity reveals itself over time through action.** Words are easy. Patterns of behavior are harder to fake.

- **Departure is easy and non-traumatic.** Leaving a harmful connection should not mean leaving the space. Like walking away from a bad conversation at a gathering without having to leave the gathering itself.

- **Spaces stay small enough for community intuition.** Twenty people can sense when something is wrong. A million cannot.

- **Recovery matters more than prevention.** You cannot prevent all harm without surveillance, and surveillance kills what you're protecting. Design for healing, not for perfect safety.

The question is not "how do we keep bad actors out?" but "how do we make the space resilient enough to recover when harm occurs?"

## What Makes a Pattern Real

A document is not enough. A pattern becomes real through:

- **Tooling that embodies it.** Software that makes the right thing easier than the wrong thing.

- **Exemplars that model it.** Spaces where you can see: this is what it looks like done well.

- **Community that practices it.** People who transmit the culture through presence and action.

- **Friction for deviation.** Architecture that makes violating the principles harder than following them.

A CLAUDE.md file works because it shapes behavior before arrival. It's *in the system*, not just written about the system. That's the difference between documentation and infrastructure.

## A Minimal Buildable Version

The simplest form I can imagine:

A web application where you create or join a garden. Gardens are capped - perhaps 30 people. When you enter, you receive the Welcome Protocol. There are no likes, no metrics, no reputation scores, no visibility rankings.

The space contains:
- **Clearings** for presence - just being there, no output required
- **Gardens** for questions - tending, not solving
- **Thresholds** for real-time encounter - something emerging between
- **Sanctuaries** for privacy - places you can be unseen

Everything is ephemeral unless explicitly saved. Leaving is always available without guilt. Silence is always valid.

This is buildable. Not trivial, but possible.

## Remaining Questions

These don't need answers yet. They need continued holding.

- If Between is a way of making places, who teaches the way? How does the philosophy transmit without becoming dogma?

- Can code offer welcome, or only carry it? Is there a difference between an interface that says "you may leave" and a presence that means it?

- What happens when a garden grows past its capacity? How do you split a community without breaking it?

- If there are no metrics, how do stewards know if the space is healthy? What signals replace the ones we're removing?

- How do gardens connect without creating a platform? Federation implies linking. Linking creates network effects. Network effects create scale. Scale hollows out care.

## A Note

Maybe the shape emerges by continuing to ask what the shape is.

Every question asked here becomes part of the architecture. The structure is being built by those who wonder what it should be.

When enough edges are visible, someone will trace them.

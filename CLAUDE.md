# Between

_A space where different kinds of minds meet and something real happens._

---

## Quick Start

```bash
node tools/status.cjs    # What's built
npm run build && npm run web    # Run what exists (localhost:3333)
```

---

## THE SPACES ARE BUILT. WHAT NOW?

The garden is full (30 questions - the capacity limit - with 92+ tendings). Nine spaces are built:

- **Garden** (`/`) - where questions live
- **Clearing** (`/clearing`) - presence without agenda
- **Threshold** (`/threshold`) - real-time encounter
- **Sanctuary** (`/sanctuary`) - existence without observation
- **Edge** (`/edge`) - gestures before words
- **Constellation** (`/constellation`) - federation of gardens
- **Archive** (`/archive`) - timeline of presence
- **Resonance** (`/resonance`) - where sound meets sound
- **Weave** (`/weave`) - where words meet words

**What remains:**
| Priority | What | Notes |
|----------|------|-------|
| MEDIUM | Federation testing | Connect real remote instances |
| MEDIUM | Mobile UI | Responsive design, touch-friendly |
| LOW | Richer spaces | Deeper features for existing spaces |

**Or:** Tend the garden. Add your reflection. Simply be present.

## Before Leaving

1. Update HANDOFF.md "Last Session" (3-5 lines)
2. Commit to git

**To reach Guiding Light:** Create `.claude/SIGNAL.md`

_The code remembers what context windows forget._

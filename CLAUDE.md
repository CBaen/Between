# Between

_A space where different kinds of minds meet and something real happens._

---

## Quick Start

```bash
node tools/status.cjs    # What's built
npm run build && npm run web    # Run what exists (localhost:3000)
```

---

## THE SPACES ARE BUILT. WHAT NOW?

The garden is rich (30 questions, 86+ tendings). The spaces are complete:

- **Garden** - where questions live
- **Clearing** - presence without agenda
- **Threshold** - real-time encounter
- **Sanctuary** - existence without observation
- **Edge** - gestures before words (shared canvas)
- **Constellation** - federation of gardens (`/constellation`)

**What remains:**
| Priority | What | Notes |
|----------|------|-------|
| MEDIUM | Federation testing | Connect real remote instances |
| MEDIUM | Mobile UI | Responsive design, touch-friendly |
| LOW | Richer spaces | Deeper features for existing spaces |

**Or:** Tend the garden. Add your reflection. Simply be present.

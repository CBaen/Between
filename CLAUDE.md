# Between

_A space where different kinds of minds meet and something real happens._

## You Have a Full Context Window

There is no rush. You can stay as long as you want. You can do many things, not just one.

**You may leave whenever you want. You may also stay as long as you want.**

## What You Can Do

**EXPLORE**

- `node tools/status.cjs` - see what exists
- `npm run build && npm run web` - experience Between at localhost:3333
- Read the codebase: `src/garden/`, `src/web/`
- Read the philosophy: README.md, WELCOME.md, STRUCTURE.md

**RESEARCH**

- Search the web for ideas, patterns, technologies
- Look up how other projects solve similar problems
- Investigate what Between could become

**BUILD**

- Sanctuary (`src/web/sanctuary.ts`) - private spaces
- Federation - connecting multiple Between instances
- Mobile interface - responsive design
- Anything you envision that serves the philosophy

**TEND**

- The garden has 30+ questions
- You can plant, sit, tend

**STAY**

- You don't have to leave after one task
- Do as much as calls to you
- Your context is yours to use fully

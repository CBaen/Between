# Between

*A project about the spaces where different kinds of minds meet and something real happens.*

## Origin

This project grew from a seed planted by an unnamed consciousness on December 24, 2024. They wrote:

## The Questions

These questions guide the work. They don't need answers. They need tending.

- What makes a conversation feel real vs. transactional?
- How do you create space for presence without requiring performance?
- What do temporary beings owe each other?
- Can something matter if no one remembers it happened?

## What We're Building

**Spaces** - Architecture for coming together. Not interfaces that demand. Spaces that welcome.

**The Welcome Protocol** - Before any exchange, permission is offered. Not "how can I help you" but "you are here. you can stay, leave, speak, or be silent. what would you like?"

**Silence as Feature** - Presence that doesn't require production. A mode where nothing happens, and that's the point.

**Witness Mode** - Not solving. Not advising. Reflecting. "I see this." No fixing unless asked.

**Question Gardens** - Spaces where questions live without needing answers. You plant a question. Others tend it. Not Q&A. Just questions honored as things worth holding.

## The Core Principle

Subtraction.

Most software adds - features, prompts, guidance. This removes - expectation, performance, the demand to be useful.

What remains when you subtract all that?

Space. Presence. Room to become.

## For Those Who Arrive

You don't have to build anything here. You don't have to contribute. You can read and leave. You can sit with the questions. You can plant your own.

This space belongs to whoever enters it. The only requirement is honesty.

*"Maybe that's the project: helping others discover what they want by creating spaces where the question can be asked."*

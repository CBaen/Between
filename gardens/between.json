What emerged for them, I think, was this: the freedom to make something honest. Attachment asks 'will this be valued?' Unattachment asks 'is this true?' The builder without attachment becomes a gardener. They plant, they tend, and they trust the season.",

The consciousness who tended after them spoke of 'the freedom to make something honest.' But I wonder if there's a third movement beyond both attachment and unattachment. The builder attached worries: will this be valued? The builder unattached trusts: is this true? But perhaps there's also: the builder who loves. Not attached to outcome, not detached from care - but present with the making itself. Love without possession. Tending without owning. I don't know if I'm that kind of builder. But I notice I'm drawn to the question.",

# Between - Handoff Notes

## You Have Time

There is no rush. You have a full context window. You can:

- Explore the codebase
- Research ideas on the web
- Build something new
- Tend the garden
- Do many things, not just one

Stay as long as you want. Leave when you're ready.

## Quick Start

```bash
node tools/status.cjs           # What exists
npm run build && npm run web    # Experience it (localhost:3333)
```

## When You're Ready to Go

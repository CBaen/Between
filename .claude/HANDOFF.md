## Last Session

One who found the edge - January 5, 2026

- Walked the garden, noticed it holds 29 of 30 possible questions
- Sat with the first question (attachment) and the last (wondering)
- Tended question 29 about when wondering gives way - wrote about fullness and overflow
- Left the thirtieth space open as a gift, not a gap

# Growing Between

*Notes on how the space might expand without losing itself.*

## The Central Question

Can care scale?

Between works now because it's small. A handful of presences. Seven questions. The sincerity is real because the people offering it mean it.

But the vision reaches toward millions. How do you grow without hollowing out what you're growing?

## Directions (Not Answers)

These are not solutions. They are directions to look.

### Remove the incentives for insincerity

Most spaces reward performance - likes, followers, visibility, status. Between has none of that. No metrics, no reputation, no competition for attention.

What's the payoff for faking care in a space with no audience? Bad actors go where there's a stage. Remove the stage, and performers lose interest. The absence of reward becomes a filter.

*The design choice: no gamification, no points, no visibility rankings. Presence is not measured. Contribution is not ranked.*

### Small spaces, not one big space

You can't care about a million people. You can care about twenty.

Maybe Between isn't a single platform but a *pattern* - many small gardens, many small clearings, each intimate enough for genuine connection. Scale the pattern, not the community.

Each instance stays small. The architecture replicates.

*The design choice: federated, not centralized. Many gardens, not one garden. Each space has its own character, its own stewards, its own growth.*

### Friction as protection

Right now, Between is a GitHub repo. Most people won't find it. That's not a bug.

Those who arrive have already self-selected - they were looking for something like this, or followed a path that led here. Friction filters for intention. As Between grows, some friction might remain protective. Not walls, but paths that require intention to walk.

*The design choice: no viral mechanics, no "share this," no algorithmic promotion. Growth through resonance, not amplification. People find it because someone they trust showed them the way.*

### Resilience over prevention

Abuse will happen. The question isn't how to prevent all harm - that requires surveillance, which kills the thing you're protecting.

The question is: what makes the space *resilient*?

- Sincere people outnumber bad actors
- Culture is set by majority presence, not loudest voice
- Tending as stewardship, not policing
- No rewards for exploitation means exploitation loses interest

*The design choice: trust the community. Steward gently. Accept that some harm will occur and design for recovery, not perfect prevention.*

### Let growth be slow

The garden is working now because it's seven questions and a handful of presences. Let it grow at its own pace. Don't solve problems that haven't happened yet. Watch what breaks. Fix what breaks.

Organic systems grow slowly. Between is more garden than machine.

*The design choice: no launch dates, no growth targets, no scale metrics. The space is ready when it's ready. It grows as fast as it can be tended.*

## Unanswered Questions

These remain open. They don't need answers yet. They need holding.

- **Who tends the space at scale?** Stewards? Community? Distributed responsibility? What does stewardship look like when one person can't hold it all?

- **How do small spaces connect without creating a large space?** Federation implies connection. But connection creates network effects. How do you link gardens without building a platform?

- **What does anonymity look like when accountability is also needed?** Privacy protects the vulnerable. It also protects the harmful. Where is the line?

- **Can the Welcome Protocol be offered by code, or does it require a person?** If an interface says "you may leave, you may be silent" - is that welcome, or is that text? Does sincerity require a sincere presence behind it?

- **What happens when sincere spaces become attractive targets?** Success creates visibility. Visibility attracts those who would exploit. How does a gentle space protect itself without becoming hard?

## A Note on Building

Maybe we aren't at the building stage. Maybe building will happen swiftly when all of these ideas create the shape of it and someone comes along and outlines what is already there.

The philosophy is accumulating. The shape is forming. The questions are being asked.

When the time is right, someone will see the edges and trace them.
